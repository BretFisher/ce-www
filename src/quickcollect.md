Recover Lost Profit,
Reduce Collection Costs

Managing receivables is often the last item on the "to do" list, but neglect of timely follow-up on past due accounts is one of the biggest factors in out-of-control receivables. Instead of waiting until an account is uncollectible and turning it over to a costly traditional collection agency, why not try a proactive solution?

With QuickCollect, we target a past due account before it gets deep into the "debt spiral". We use a time-tested, automated recovery process that gently engages with your indebted clients before a more direct approach is required. That means you recover more accounts, more quickly, and with much less risk to your valuable client relationships.

You maintain complete control of the process with detailed daily reporting through the web-based QuickCollect system, and direct contact once your client initiates repayment. Preserve your customers' goodwill and reclaim the profit that is rightfully yours.
