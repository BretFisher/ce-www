Guard Profits, Reduce Errors

Wouldn't it be great if you had the ability to maintain the highest level of compliance while actually increasing your reimbursement rates?

You can with our comprehensive AuditGuard service.

With AuditGuard, our certified coders will provide a thorough review of your coding, billing, and reimbursement processes. We can identify areas of risk for your practice and even provide training for documentation techniques that could improve your workflow.

Once the audit is performed, you'll be given a detailed report and a consultation with an AuditGuard specialist. We go beyond a simple error report and actually recommend corrective actions. We can even provide the support and training to implement AuditGuard solutions.
