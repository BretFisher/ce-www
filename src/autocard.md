When was the last time you sent a thank you card or checkup reminder to your patient base? We've found that most doctor's offices simply don't have time to manage ongoing marketing efforts to valuable patients.

We've got the solution.

Our AutoCard marketing service will allow you to send personalized postcards, greeting cards, and even brochures to your current patient database. We can even design campaigns that automatically send cards at regular intervals throughout the year.

You can increase appointments and build upon the valuable relationships you have with your patients. We will set up campaigns based on your needs with a wide variety of options: flu shot reminders, back-to-school physicals, yearly checkup reminders, and even follow-up cards to ensure your patients continue to choose you for their healthcare needs.

Set your marketing on autopilot, and let our AutoCard service increase patient satisfaction and improve your bottom line.
